Description: Displays palette of 5 colors based on photos depicting the unique 
             and vibrant culture of Punjab in Northern India. Since Punjab translates 
             to ``Land of 5 Rivers'' there are 5 colors per palette. If users need 
             more than 5 colors, they can 2 merge palettes to create their own 
             color-combination. Users can view colors of 1 or 2 palettes together. 
             Users can also list all the palette choices. And last but not least, 
             users can see the photo that inspired a particular palette.
