Authors@R: person("Artie", "Ladie", email = "artie.ladie@this.is.fake.email.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Displays palette of 5 colors based on photos depicting the unique 
             and vibrant culture of Punjab in Northern India. Since Punjab translates 
             to ``Land of 5 Rivers'' there are 5 colors per palette. If users need 
             more than 5 colors, they can merge 2 to 3 palettes to create their own 
             color-combination. Users can view up to 3 palettes together. 
             Users can also list all the palette choices. And last but not least, 
             users can see the photo that inspired a particular palette.
