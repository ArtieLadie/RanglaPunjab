# Palettes

### FieldsOfPunjab

Punjab translates to "Land of Five Rivers". 

These rivers refer to the rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas. 

All are tributaries of the Indus River, the Chenab being the largest. 

The five rivers makes Punjab one of the most fertile regions of India. 

Plus the fields provide beautiful backdrop to [Bollywood films](https://www.news18.com/news/lifestyle/10-bollywood-films-that-will-make-you-love-punjab-even-more-1019780.html).

### FieldsOfPunjab2

Punjab's fields are so breath-taking, had to add another palette.

### GoldenTemple

[Golden Temple](http://www.northsouthtravel.com/10-interesting-facts-about-the-golden-temple) is the oldest place of worship for [Sikhs](https://www.sikhnet.com/pages/who-are-sikhs-what-is-sikhism).

![Golden Temple](https://github.com/ArtieLadie/RanglaPunjab/blob/master/inst/img/goldentemple.jpg)

### GoldenTemple2

And because the Golden Temple looks so different at night, had to add another palette.

### Pindh

Pindh translates to Village. Villages make up the bedrock of Punjab.

### Haveli

Havelis were grand mansions that bustled with life generations ago. 

Many havelis have fallen into disrepair, yet they remain beautiful reminants of an era gone by.

![Haveli](https://github.com/ArtieLadie/RanglaPunjab/blob/master/inst/img/haveli.jpg)

### Haveli2

Havelis always had a [courtyard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haveli). Usually light, airy, with meticulously decorated structures.

### AmritsariLassi

[Amritsari Lassi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QuPPmOYs6U) is a thick, cooling yogurt-based (almost buttermilk) drink that compliments these heavy meals.

Or, Lassi can be enjoyed on it's own :-)

### AmritsariPedeWaliLassi

Lassi can also be a dessert.

[Amritsari Pede Wali Lassi](https://www.bigbasket.com/cookbook/recipes/2329/amritsari-pede-wali-lassi/?nc=bt) is a decadant, cooling drink that includes [milk-based pastries](https://www.milkmaid.in/recipes/malai-peda).

Certainly gives Hot Cocao and Marshmallows a run for their money!

### Kulfi

[Kulfi](http://www.grubstreet.com/2015/06/babu-ji-traditional-kulfi.html), a savory ice cream (ice cream is an under-statement) treat. Pistachio-based is most popular, yet it can be any flavor.

### Phulkari

[Phulkari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phulkari) is an embroidery technique that means "Flower Work". In olden days women created these colorful shawls for themselves and family, making it a true folk art of Punjab. Now the Government is trying to promote this artform.

![Phulkari](https://github.com/ArtieLadie/RanglaPunjab/blob/master/inst/img/phulkari.jpg)

### Phulkari2

Because I love colors so much.

Phulkaris are usually made into [Dupattas](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dupatta) to be worn with [Salwar Kameez](http://www.panashindia.com/salwar/punjabi-suits) (Punjabi ladies's suit), as shown in the reference photo.
