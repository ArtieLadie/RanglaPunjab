# RanglaPunjab

R code that defines color palettes based on the unique, vibrant culture of [Punjab, India](https://wikitravel.org/en/Punjab_(India)). 

Rangla Punjab translates to ["Colorful Punjab"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MRFMUg4LmQ).

And if you ever visit India, [Rangla Punjab](https://haveli.co/rangla-punjab/) is a wonderful Punjabi theme village of generations gone by. 

In the meantime, enjoy this R package :-)

### Fields of Punjab

Punjab translates to "Land of Five Rivers". These rivers refer to the rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas. All are tributaries of the Indus River, the Chenab being the largest. These rivers makes Punjab one of the most fertile regions of India. 

Plus the fields provide beautiful backdrop to [Bollywood films](https://www.news18.com/news/lifestyle/10-bollywood-films-that-will-make-you-love-punjab-even-more-1019780.html).
